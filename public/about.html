    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Nyaing Kyaw (pronounced “Nye”), and I am a junior
      undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am
      working toward a B.S. in Information Science and currently serve as an
      Academic Peer Mentor (AMP) for Dr. Sarah Lee in INST314 (Statistics for
      Information Science) and Ms. Pamela Duffy in INST327 (Database Design and
      Modeling), since January 26, 2026. In a few years, I see myself attending
      graduate school for Product Management or pursuing a career in Product
      Management.
