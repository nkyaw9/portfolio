        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support hands-on activities (e.g.,
        <strong
          >MySQL Workbench ERDs, PK/FK relationships, JOINs, aggregations, and
          views</strong
        >) and help troubleshoot database errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mentor project teams on database planning, documentation, and
        implementation (schema, sample data, query design).

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Facilitate discussion/lab learning in small groups by coaching students
        through <strong>statistical inference</strong> (estimation + hypothesis
        testing) and interpretation of results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support hands-on work in <strong>R/RStudio</strong>: summarizing data

        issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        Help students use <strong>regression in R</strong> to understand how one
        or more factors predict an outcome, and explain results in clear,
        nontechnical terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reinforce strong data practices:
        <strong
          >data collection limits, scope of inference, and evaluating data-based
          claims</strong
        >.

      </strong>
      <br />
      Dec 15, 2025
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed and implemented a normalized
        <strong>7-table relational schema</strong> (PK/FK constraints + bridge
        table) to model Montgomery County crime incidents for analysis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Built a <strong>MySQL Workbench ERD</strong> and forward-engineered the
        database, including sample data and reproducible setup via SQL backup
        script.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developed <strong>6 analytical SQL views</strong> (e.g., counts by
        city/ZIP, offense/category summaries, multi-offense incidents,
        victims-per-offense, time-of-day trends).
      </li>
      <li>
        Applied <strong>privacy-aware database design</strong> by focusing on
        aggregated reporting and excluding sensitive, person-level identifiers.
      </li>
    </ul>
